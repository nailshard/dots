# Refactoring
So the panel is pretty much done, now I just need to refactor it.

[x] Integrate the time hacky time bar with the rest of the panel and make the 
    old implemmentation go away
[x] Separate the widgets displayed from the preparatory work to get those widgets
    in the right place
[x] Find a better way to scale the buttons widget
[x] Delete the unnecessary, old, commented-out code
[x] Take out all the `naughty` debugging pieces of code
[x] Add a hot corner for the exitpanel on the top-right half
[ ] Find a way to not hardcode the buttons name with their numbers
[ ] Make the vi-textbox scroll when the text gets too long
