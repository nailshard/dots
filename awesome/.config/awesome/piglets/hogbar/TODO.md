Roughly, these are the things I'm trying to do with the hogbar
##TODO

### Features

    [ ] Have it show the clock in the middle
    [ ] Have it change colors based on what background I have
    [ ] Have it show me what programs I have open
    [ ] Make it show me the tag number I'm currently on
    [ ] Have a "power panel" button
    [ ] Write a systray

### Refactoring
    [ ] Take out the nasty clock bar that puts the clock in the middle
