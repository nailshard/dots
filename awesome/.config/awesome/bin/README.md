# Scripts
So bacisally, this is where I store my scripts that are used by certain parts
of the awesome window manager. I'll also do my best to list here which part uses which
script from this directory

+ `volumectl` script - uses the keys `mod + F1|F2|F3|F4` for controlling volume
+ `get_weather.sh` script - gets weather data using the openweathermap api
