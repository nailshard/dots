# The reason for this script:
# Problem:
#   the sane ways calling scripts once every `x` amount of time in awesome
#   don't maintain their state across awesome restarts and automatically invoke
#   the script when awesome restarts.
#   If you use the openweathermap api too much, they ban your account.
#   And to test new changes in awesome, you have to restart it.
#   So we can't call the openweathermap api from awesome too much, or we'll get banned

#   Solution :
#   Write this script separately, set up a cron job that would call the script
#   once every 2 hours and write the weather status to a file
#   Then have awesome read the file to get weather info.
#   This way we can restart awesome as much as we want and not get banned (*cool-as-fuck-emoji-rn*)
